Requirements
===========

pocketsphinx	
gstreamer (and what ever plugin has pocket sphinx support)
pyside (only required for the Qt based UI)

0. move commands.tmp to ~/.config/blather/commands and fill the file with sentences and command to run

1. Run blather.py, this will generate ~/.config/blather/sentences.corpus based on sentences in the 'commands' file
2. quit blather (there is a good chance it will just segfault)
3. go to <http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/tools/lmtool-new.html> and upload the sentences.corpus file
4. download the resulting XXXX.lm file to the ~/.config/blather/language directory and rename to file to 'lm'
5. download the resulting XXXX.dic file to the ~/.config/blather/language directory and rename to file to 'dic'
6. run blather.py
    * for Qt GUI, run blather.py -qt
7. start talking

####Bonus
once the sentences.corpus file has been created, run the language_updater.sh to automate the process of creating and downloading language files.
