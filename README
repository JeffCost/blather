#Blather
Blather is a speech recognizer that will run commands when a user speaks preset sentences. 

##Requirements
1. pocketsphinx	
2. gstreamer (and what ever plugin has pocket sphinx support)  
3. pyside (only required for the Qt based UI)
4. pygtk (only required for the Gtk based UI)

##Usage
0. move commands.tmp to ~/.config/blather/commands and fill the file with sentences and command to run
1. Run Blather.py, this will generate ~/.config/blather/sentences.corpus based on sentences in the 'commands' file
2. quit blather (there is a good chance it will just segfault)
3. go to <http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/tools/lmtool-new.html> and upload the sentences.corpus file
4. download the resulting XXXX.lm file to the ~/.config/blather/language directory and rename to file to 'lm'
5. download the resulting XXXX.dic file to the ~/.config/blather/language directory and rename to file to 'dic'
6. run Blather.py
    * for Qt GUI, run Blather.py -qt
    * for Gtk GUI, run Blather.py -gtk
7. start talking

####Bonus
once the sentences.corpus file has been created, run the language_updater.sh script to automate the process of creating and downloading language files.
